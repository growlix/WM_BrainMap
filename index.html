      target="_blank">review</a> on the evidence for working memory-related activity across
      different regions of the brain. To gain a birdâ€™s-eye perspective on the
      state of the research, we generated a database of electrophysiological
      working memory studies involving tasks that incorporate a delay period
      between a stimulus and a response. We then determined the cortical areas
      examined in each study and whether the authors positively or negatively
      reported activity that encoded memory for locations, features, or objects.
      <br><br>The bar plot on the right displays the positive (red) and negative
      (blue) reports of working memory-related activity in different macaque
      brain regions. The criterion defining a positive report was the presence
      of delay activity during a working memory task, while the criterion for a
      negative report was the absence of delay activity (i.e. a negative result).
      <br><br>The data from the bar plot are projected on to an inflated map of the
      macaque cortex on the left. Each region is color-coded according to the
      number of studies positively or negatively reporting working
      memory-related activity. Note the tendency toward more negative reports in
      early sensory cortices, and more positive reports in association cortices.
      Also note that the color map is scaled by the largest total number of
      studies in any single area. Inflated macaque cortical map courtesy of
